Program 1: ray casting
----------------------

Steps to run the program:
-------------------------
Open the index.html file, it will ask for some inputs like window dimensions, canvas dimensions, eye position etc.
Provide all these inputs and click submit. If nothing is given, then it will take default values.

Extra credit questions:
----------------------
1. I tried doing “Arbitrarily sized images and viewports” where user can specify canvas dimensions 
   and the image will change accordingly.
2. I tried doing “Arbitrary viewing setups” where user can specify eye location. Also user can give 
   window dimensions with their center.
3. In the shadow part, if user has checkmarked the box thenonly ambient light is used, otherwise 
   sum of all three lights is used.
